# Counter Dapp
## _A decentralized counter application_

Counter-dapp is a simple web application that a user can increment or decerement a couner variable stored on the blockchain in exchange of small amount of gas fees.

The app it self doesnt make any sense as who would pay money to incerement a useless counter :), the main purpose of the app was to teach me simple interactions with the blockcain, as I am still on my learingn phase
